Magma is a closed-source computer algebra system focused on number theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry. There is a handy {{% resource_link "31ae4692-6d20-4650-b3a4-9cb552c787a1" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations, and a command line interface that you can run from many of the math department servers (type **magma** at the command line).

### {{% resource_link "1956403b-33e7-41f6-9fbc-061dbb65d7ea" "PARI/GP" %}}

PARI/GP is an open-source computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory. PARI is a fast C-library and GP is a script language interface to PARI that runs in an interactive shell (command-line only, no browser interface). Many Sage functions are implemented using PARI (you can directly call PARI and GP functions from within Sage).Â

Sage is an open-source computer algebra system that includes extensive support for number theory. {{% resource_link "98c96991-8988-421f-a255-365a156d2494" "CoCalc" %}} (formerly SageMathCloud) provides a notebook interface to Sage that runs in any browser and is hosted in the cloud; no software installation is required and there is no cost to register for an account. You can also {{% resource_link "7d8eb7c7-6b82-4cb9-9667-ab1d181517f5" "download" %}} a copy of Sage to run on your own machine if you wish.

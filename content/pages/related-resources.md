Magma is a closed-source computer algebra system focused on number theory, group theory, and algebraic geometry. There is a handy {{% resource_link "7881e6ee-1158-466d-8838-b7af73ec58f9" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations, and a command line interface that you can run from many of the math department servers (type **magma** at the command line).

PARI/GP is an open-source computer algebra system designed for fast computations in number theory. PARI is a fast C-library and GP is a script language interface to PARI that runs in an interactive shell (command-line only, no browser interface). Many Sage functions are implemented using PARI (you can directly call PARI and GP functions from within Sage). Like Magma, PARI/GP also has an {{% resource_link "ecc5ed4e-e89b-4d1f-91b0-e5864ddb1dbe" "online calculator" %}} for quick calculations.

Sage is an open-source computer algebra system that includes extensive support for number theory. {{% resource_link "f4aa4be5-097b-4b4a-b3e2-377cc3ad392d" "CoCalc" %}} (formerly SageMathCloud) provides a notebook interface to Sage that runs in any browser and is hosted in the cloud; no software installation is required and there is no cost to register for an account. You can also {{% resource_link "d376535d-557a-4f73-a818-b23d6169e598" "download" %}} a copy of Sage to run on your own machine if you wish.
